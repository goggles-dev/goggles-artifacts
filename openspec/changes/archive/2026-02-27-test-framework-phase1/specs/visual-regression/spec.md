## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Image comparison library
The system SHALL provide a C++ image comparison library at `tests/visual/image_compare.hpp` that compares two PNG images with configurable per-channel tolerance.

#### Scenario: Identical images pass
- **GIVEN** two PNG files with identical pixel data
- **WHEN** `compare_images(actual_path, reference_path, tolerance)` is called with any tolerance ≥ 0
- **THEN** `CompareResult.passed` SHALL be `true`
- **AND** `CompareResult.max_channel_diff` SHALL be `0.0`
- **AND** `CompareResult.failing_pixels` SHALL be `0`

#### Scenario: Differing images fail at zero tolerance
- **GIVEN** two PNG files where at least one pixel differs by 1 channel value
- **WHEN** `compare_images()` is called with `tolerance = 0.0`
- **THEN** `CompareResult.passed` SHALL be `false`
- **AND** `CompareResult.failing_pixels` SHALL be ≥ 1

#### Scenario: Tolerance allows small differences
- **GIVEN** two PNG files where all pixels differ by at most 2/255 per channel
- **WHEN** `compare_images()` is called with `tolerance = 2.0/255.0`
- **THEN** `CompareResult.passed` SHALL be `true`

#### Scenario: CompareResult fields are populated
- **GIVEN** a comparison that produces failures
- **WHEN** `compare_images()` returns
- **THEN** `CompareResult.max_channel_diff` SHALL be the maximum per-channel delta across all pixels (normalized 0.0–1.0)
- **AND** `CompareResult.mean_diff` SHALL be the mean per-pixel average-channel delta
- **AND** `CompareResult.failing_percentage` SHALL equal `failing_pixels / (width * height)` × 100

#### Scenario: Diff image is generated on failure
- **GIVEN** a comparison that fails AND `diff_output_path` is provided
- **WHEN** `compare_images()` returns
- **THEN** a PNG SHALL be written at `diff_output_path`
- **AND** pixels that exceeded tolerance SHALL be highlighted in red (255, 0, 0, 255) in the diff image
- **AND** passing pixels SHALL be shown at reduced intensity (≤ 25% of original value)

#### Scenario: Size mismatch is a failure
- **GIVEN** two PNG files with different dimensions
- **WHEN** `compare_images()` is called
- **THEN** `CompareResult.passed` SHALL be `false`
- **AND** an error message describing the dimension mismatch SHALL be set

### Requirement: Image comparison CLI tool
The system SHALL provide a `goggles_image_compare` CLI binary that wraps the comparison library for use in shell scripts and pixi tasks.

#### Scenario: Pass exit code
- **WHEN** `goggles_image_compare actual.png reference.png --tolerance 0.01` is run and images match within tolerance
- **THEN** the process SHALL exit with code 0

#### Scenario: Fail exit code
- **WHEN** `goggles_image_compare actual.png reference.png --tolerance 0.0` is run and images differ
- **THEN** the process SHALL exit with code 1
- **AND** a summary SHALL be printed to stdout including `failing_pixels` and `max_channel_diff`

#### Scenario: Diff image output
- **WHEN** `--diff diff.png` is passed and the comparison fails
- **THEN** a diff PNG SHALL be written to `diff.png`

#### Scenario: Missing file error
- **WHEN** either `actual.png` or `reference.png` does not exist
- **THEN** the process SHALL exit with code 2 and print an error to stderr

### Requirement: Headless pipeline smoke test
The system SHALL provide a CTest integration test that exercises the full `Application::create_headless()` → filter chain → `readback_to_png()` pipeline.

#### Scenario: Smoke test produces a valid PNG
- **GIVEN** the `visual-test` preset is built (includes `goggles` binary and `solid_color_client`)
- **WHEN** CTest runs the headless smoke test
- **THEN** `goggles --headless --frames 5 --output <tmp>/smoke.png -- solid_color_client` SHALL exit with code 0
- **AND** `<tmp>/smoke.png` SHALL be a valid PNG file with width > 0 and height > 0

#### Scenario: Smoke test is labeled integration
- **GIVEN** the `visual-test` CTest configuration
- **WHEN** `ctest -L integration` is run
- **THEN** the headless smoke test SHALL be included in the run

#### Scenario: Smoke test is excluded from unit tier
- **WHEN** `ctest -L unit` is run
- **THEN** the headless smoke test SHALL NOT be included
